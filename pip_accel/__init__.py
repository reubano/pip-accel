Top level functionality of `pip-accel`.

The Python module :mod:`pip_accel` defines the classes that implement the
top level functionality of the pip accelerator. Instead of using the
``pip-accel`` command you can also use the pip accelerator as a Python module,
in this case you'll probably want to start by taking a look at
the :class:`PipAccelerator` class.

Wheel support
-------------

During the upgrade to pip 6 support for installation of wheels_ was added to
pip-accel. The ``pip-accel`` command line program now downloads and installs
wheels when available for a given requirement, but part of pip-accel's Python
API defaults to the more conservative choice of allowing callers to opt-in to
wheel support.

This is because previous versions of pip-accel would only download source
distributions and pip-accel provides the functionality to convert those source
distributions to "dumb binary distributions". This functionality is exposed to
callers who may depend on this mode of operation. So for now users of the
Python API get to decide whether they're interested in wheels or not.

Setuptools upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the requirement set includes wheels and ``setuptools >= 0.8`` is not yet
installed, it will be added to the requirement set and installed together with
the other requirement(s) in order to enable the usage of distributions
installed from wheels (their metadata is different).

        Cleanup broken symbolic links in the local source distribution index.

        The purpose of this method requires some context to understand. Let me
        preface this by stating that I realize I'm probably overcomplicating
        things, but I like to preserve forward / backward compatibility when
        possible and I don't feel like dropping everyone's locally cached
        source distribution archives without a good reason to do so. With that
        out of the way:

        - Versions of pip-accel based on pip 1.4.x maintained a local source
          distribution index based on a directory containing symbolic links
          pointing directly into pip's download cache. When files were removed
          from pip's download cache, broken symbolic links remained in
          pip-accel's local source distribution index directory. This resulted
          in very confusing error messages. To avoid this
          :func:`clean_source_index()` cleaned up broken symbolic links
          whenever pip-accel was about to invoke pip.

        - More recent versions of pip (6.x) no longer support the same style of
          download cache that contains source distribution archives that can be
          re-used directly by pip-accel. To cope with the changes in pip 6.x
          new versions of pip-accel tell pip to download source distribution
          archives directly into the local source distribution index directory
          maintained by pip-accel.

        - It is very reasonable for users of pip-accel to have multiple
          versions of pip-accel installed on their system (imagine a dozen
          Python virtual environments that won't all be updated at the same
          time; this is the situation I always find myself in :-). These
          versions of pip-accel will be sharing the same local source
          distribution index directory.

        - All of this leads up to the local source distribution index directory
          containing a mixture of symbolic links and regular files with no
          obvious way to atomically and gracefully upgrade the local source
          distribution index directory while avoiding fights between old and
          new versions of pip-accel :-).

        - I could of course switch to storing the new local source distribution
          index in a differently named directory (avoiding potential conflicts
          between multiple versions of pip-accel) but then I would have to
          introduce a new configuration option, otherwise everyone who has
          configured pip-accel to store its source index in a non-default
          location could still be bitten by compatibility issues.

        For now I've decided to keep using the same directory for the local
        source distribution index and to keep cleaning up broken symbolic
        links. This enables cooperating between old and new versions of
        pip-accel and avoids trashing user's local source distribution indexes.
        The main disadvantage is that pip-accel is still required to clean up
        broken symbolic links...

        When pip-accel calls pip to download missing distribution archives and
        the user specified the pathname of a local distribution archive on the
        command line, pip will (by default) *not* copy the archive into the
        download directory if an archive for the same package name and
        version is already present.

        This can lead to the confusing situation where the user specifies a
        local distribution archive to install, a different (older) archive for
        the same package and version is present in the download directory and
        `pip-accel` installs the older archive instead of the newer archive.

        To avoid this confusing behavior, the :func:`decorate_arguments()`
        method rewrites the command line arguments given to ``pip install`` so
        that pathnames of local archives are changed into ``file://`` URLs that
        include a fragment with the hash of the file's contents. Here's an

        When pip fills the download directory and encounters a previously
        cached distribution archive it will check the hash, realize the
        contents have changed and replace the archive in the download
        directory.
